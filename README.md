Modern JavaScript from the beginning - all the way up to JS expert level! THE must-have JavaScript resource in 2024

## Requirements

- NO prior JavaScript knowledge is required
- Basic web development knowledge is recommended
- Basic understanding of HTML and CSS helps but is NOT required

## What's in the course?

This course is obviously packed with content - I therefore strongly recommend that you check out the full course curriculum to get a clear idea of all the topics covered in the course. In general, here's what you'll find in the course:

- Modern JavaScript from the start: The JavaScript syntax changed over time - in this course, you'll learn the latest syntax from the start (you'll also learn about the old one though, so that you can work in ANY JS project)
- ALL the Basics: Variables, constants, functions, how scripts are loaded etc
- Arrays & Objects: We'll explore these very important data structures in great detail
- Control Structures: Understand how to run code conditionally and in loops
- A look behind the Scenes: How JavaScript engines work behind the scenes and what that means for us
- Deep dives into Core Concepts: ALL the special things about JavaScript function, different syntaxes
- Working with the DOM: How to manipulate web pages dynamically via JavaScript (including deep dives and different use-cases)
- Events in JavaScript: Learn how to listen to a broad variety of events (e.g. drag & drop) and execute appropriate code
- Classes & Object-oriented Programming: Learn how to work with classes, prototypes, the "this" keyword, constructor functions and much more
- Asynchronous and Synchronous Programming: We'll explore callbacks, promises, async/ await and other important tools and language features to execute code correctly
- Http Requests: Learn how to send Http requests via JavaScript
- Tooling, Optimizations & Browser Support: Code splitting, producing small code and ensuring that scripts work in all browsers - this matters and hence is covered in great detail
- Libraries & Frameworks: Learn about libraries like Axios or frameworks like React.js - why they matter and how to use them
- Node.js: Whilst focusing on the browser-side for the majority of the course (because the syntax is the same), we'll also have a dedicated section on Node.js to learn all about that JS host environment
- Security & Performance Optimizations: Of course security matters, so does performance - no surprise that both is covered in the course!
- Automated Testing: Testing manually is hard work and can be unreliable - in this course you'll also get an introduction into automated testing

## Who this course is for:
- Beginner web development students who have no or only little JavaScript experience
- Also developers who know the basics about JavaScript and want to deepen their knowledge
- Advanced JavaScript developers who want to learn more about the nitty-gritty details and dive into advanced concepts
- Everyone interested in learning JavaScript and all about how it works
